# Balanced Search Trees

This was one of my first Undergraduate mini projects from back in 2015. Current repository includes the implementation of B-Trees and 2-3 Trees which are used for efficient Database indexing. Being only an amateur programmer during it's implementation, this project taught me a lot about Data Structures and also about Recursive algorithms.

Also, I had improvised the code to draw the corresponding trees using an Open Source software called Graphviz.
